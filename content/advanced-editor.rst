Advanced Editor
===============

This feature add-on allows OTRS administrators and OTRS developers with experience using Template Toolkit to write Template Toolkit code snippets in OTRS templates. This can facilitate, for example, the customization of response templates with multiple languages because you can customize the same template for many languages by using conditions without adding completely new response templates. This saves resources within OTRS and gives you a cleaner overview of your response templates.

Benefits
   - Easier customization of response templates based on conditions.
   - Resource-saving usage of response templates.
   - Increases your OTRS performance.

Available in Service Package
   GOLD

Target Groups
   - OTRS administrators with Template Toolkit experience
   - Organizations that want to easily customize their OTRS templates, e.g. for many languages
