Automated FAQ Ticket Creator
============================

With the help of this feature add-on, it is possible to create time-controlled tickets via FAQ entries. This can refer to the FAQ entry itself or to a specific task that is related to the FAQ topic. This is particularly useful in situations, such as maintenance work, where routine activities take place at large intervals. The automatically generated ticket becomes a *To do* for the employee. And, through the FAQ documentation, everyone knows the steps of the task.

Example
   An employee creates a FAQ entry for a specific maintenance task. The feature add-on will now automatically create an associated ticket after a specified period of time, reminding an employee to either renew the FAQ or to perform the activity described in the FAQ entry. For new employees who do not have experience, the FAQ makes it possible for them to perform the activity too, because the steps are clearly described in the documentation.

Benefits
   - Keep FAQs up-to-date with reminders about necessary update.
   - Less frequently opened *resubmission tickets*.
   - Functionality can be used for one-time activities that include an end date.
   - Even complex tasks can be done by new or untrained employees.
