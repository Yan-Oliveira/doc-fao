Automatic Start of Processes
============================

Recurring tasks can be digitized particularly well. Creating process tickets on a schedule relieves your agents, and even your customers, of the obligation to think about the tasks. Once set up, steps can be automated and begun without manual intervention. Documentation of task fulfillment develops naturally as the ticket moves through the process.
