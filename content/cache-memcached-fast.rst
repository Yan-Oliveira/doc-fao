Cache Memcached Fast
====================

This feature add-on allows the use of a memory backend for the caches used in **OTRS**. This package makes it possible to allocate the entire cache through the Round Robin method on several memcached servers.

The number of memcached servers that can be used is unlimited. After proper setup of the memcached servers, you can use **OTRS** to configure which of them should be used by OTRS. We strongly recommend that configuration is carried out only by our **OTRS** consultants.

Benefits
   - Smooth deployment of **OTRS** in a high-availability environment.

Available in Service Package
   PLATINUM

Target Groups
   - Businesses that use **OTRS** in a high-availability environment.
