Calendar Resource Planning
==========================

This feature add-on gives you an operations overview of the entire team. And thatâ€™s not all. Dynamic fields, reporting functions and notifications can make your work simpler by allowing you to have individualized calendar views, resource planning per person or team, and selected import options into the calendar.

Additionally, customer and ticket data can be synchronized from a linked ticket into an appointment. This data can then be made available to the agent in the field as an offline local calendar. By linking the calendar entries with tickets, you always have complete details about your appointments on hand.

With pre-defined authorization groups, you can even create shared calendars for select teams. Now, important information, such as meetings or deadlines, are available for all relevant agents.

Visualize which agent has which tasks to perform and how much time is estimated for completing these. Meetings, appointments and simple project planning can now be displayed centrally in **OTRS** for the entire department.
