Administrator Interface
=======================

This package extends the *Calendar Management* screen with a new section to set default values and add dynamic fields to appointments. New management screens for teams and team agents are also available from the :doc:`agent/calendar/manage-teams` and :doc:`agent/calendar/manage-team-agents` menu item of the *Calendar* menu in the agent interface. It is also possible to send out ICS files in appointment notifications.
