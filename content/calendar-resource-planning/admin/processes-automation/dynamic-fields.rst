Dynamic Fields
==============

Use this screen to manage dynamic fields for appointments. Dynamic fields for appointments have to be configured in the same way as dynamic fields for other object. Once you have set up the dynamic fields, you have to activate the dynamic fields for calendars.

To activate dynamic fields for calendars:

1. Go to the :doc:`../administration/calendars` screen.
2. Select a calendar or create a new one.
3. Find the *Dynamic Fields* section in the *Manage Settings* widget.
4. Define for each appointment dynamic field to *Hide*, *Show* or *Show as mandatory*.

Dynamic fields are available in the linked appointments widget in the *Ticket Zoom* screen as well.
