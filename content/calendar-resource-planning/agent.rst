Agent Interface
===============

This feature add-on enhances the original calendar implementation by introducing resource allocation for appointments. Furthermore, resources can be assigned to separate teams, which in turn can be used to filter resource overview and availability. The appointments now can be used in dynamic list statistics.

.. note::

   The agent have to be the member of ``admin`` group to access :doc:`agent/calendar/manage-calendars`, :doc:`agent/calendar/manage-teams` and :doc:`agent/calendar/manage-team-agents` screens.
