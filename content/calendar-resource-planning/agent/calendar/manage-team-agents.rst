Manage Team Agents
==================

.. note::

   You have to be the member of ``admin`` group to access this screen.

Once you have set up a team in :doc:`manage-teams` screen, you must define which agents belong to which teams. To use this function, at least one agent and one team need to have been added to the system. The management screen is available in the *Manage Team Agents* menu item of the *Calendar* menu. Additionally, it is also accessible from the :doc:`resource-overview` and :doc:`manage-teams` screens.
