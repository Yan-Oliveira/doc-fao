Custom Contact Fields
=====================

This feature add-on makes it possible to create new *customer* dynamic fields, which can store customer data from integrated external customer databases as contacts in a ticket. In an additional configuration interface, it is possible to define whether the new dynamic field type should:

- Store one or more customers.
- Add an additional navigation option in the OTRS customer portal.
- Include additional contacts in the ticket communication.
- Restrict the adding of new contacts based on customer number or postal codes.
- Be filterable for certain attributes.

Furthermore, event-based notifications can now be configured to be sent to contacts that are stored in the ticket.

This feature add-on is perfect for all businesses that have to deal with different groups of customers, partners or sub-contractors, as it adds, in addition to the OTRS *Customer Information Center*, a second possibility for storing customer data in a ticket and including it in communication processes.

Benefits
   - More flexible and enhanced storage of external customer data in tickets.
   - More transparent and automated communication with business partners, sub-contractors or suppliers.
   - Seamless integration of external customer databases into **OTRS**.
