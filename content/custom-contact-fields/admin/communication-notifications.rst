Communication & Notifications
=============================

For the external interface, the functionality is by default limited to search just contacts that are from the same company. Otherwise all contacts of all companies would be visible to every customer user that has access to the external interface.

If you want to make all contacts searchable by every customer user, you can enable this by removing the tick from the system configuration option ``Core::CustomContactFieldsRestrictContactsToCustomerOnly`` and setting it as not enabled.

To activate sending emails to custom contact field customers, go to the *Ticket Notifications* module of the *Communication & Notifications* group in the administrator interface.
