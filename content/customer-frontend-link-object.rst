Customer Frontend Link Object
=============================

With this feature add-on, linked FAQs, tickets and other objects, can be displayed in the ticket detail view of the external interface. In the system configuration, you can easily select whether you want to display linked tickets and/or FAQ articles in the external interface.

In addition, the feature add-on ensures that only those linked tickets for which the customer user has read or write access rights are displayed. If this is not the case, linked tickets are not displayed to stop the customer user from receiving unnecessary error messages.
