External Interface
==================

This package has no external interface, but it shows linked tickets and FAQs in ticket detail view.

To use this functionality, an agent has to create tickets and FAQ articles in :doc:`agent` and link them together.

To see the linked object in external interface:

1. Log in as customer user.
2. Select *My Tickets* from the ticket menu.
3. Select a ticket that has linked ticket and/or FAQ articles.
4. See the widget containing the linked objects in the right sidebar of the ticket detail view.

Clicking on a ticket or FAQ article will lead you to the linked ticket or FAQ article.
