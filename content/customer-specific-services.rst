Customer-specific Services
==========================

This feature add-on makes it possible to assign services to customers so that only the assigned service is displayed when a ticket is created and only the appropriate SLAs are valid.

After installation of the package, a new module *Customers â†” Service* appears in the *Users, Groups & Roles* group in the administrator interface. Here you can define which services should be assigned to customers.

Furthermore, you can define in the system configuration which of these options should be the leading one.
