Administrator Interface
=======================

After installation of the package a new module will be available in the *User, Groups & Roles* group of the administrator interface.

.. note::

   The determination of the customers is based on a customer user search. So it is very important to adjust the ``CustomerUserSearchListLimit`` setting in the ``CustomerUser`` section in the ``Kernel/Config.pm``. Otherwise not all customers can be found and displayed.
