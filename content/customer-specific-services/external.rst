External Interface
==================

This package has no external interface, but the service selection can be restricted to the configured ones.


Restrict Service Selection
--------------------------

.. seealso::

   The ``ExternalFrontend::TicketCreate###Service`` setting needs to be enabled to use this feature.

In the *New Ticket* screen only the services which are related to the customer of the customer user will be available. After the service is chosen by the customer user, the associated service level agreements (SLA) will become available, if they are configured.
