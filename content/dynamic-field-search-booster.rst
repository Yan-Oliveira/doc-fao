Dynamic Field Search Booster
============================

For the ticket search in the agent or customer interface, existing values of the database are collected in dynamic fields. In highly frequented systems with a large amount of tickets and/or dynamic fields, the high number of entries that have to be searched can cause a considerable delay in the search process. Search results in these systems can only be cached for a short time and then the database inquiry has to be done again. Dynamic Field Search Booster keeps track of the values used for all relevant dynamic fields and their frequency. In the event of a new inquiry, the feature add-on can now provide the data very quickly. Unnecessary load times are reduced considerably.

Benefits
   - Fast database inquiries.
