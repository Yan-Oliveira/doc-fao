Dynamic Sender Addresses
========================

The sender address of your tickets in the standard version of **OTRS** is by default a queue-associated email address. In order to configure the sender address this feature add-on uses a special dynamic field. When replying or forwarding tickets and event-based notifications, **OTRS** automatically sets the new sender address. When the dynamic field is blank, the queue-associated email address is used.

In addition, you can also use this feature add-on to edit tickets from all over the world and use country-specific sender addresses. By grouping the countries and email addresses **OTRS** can automatically add the correct return address for each country.
