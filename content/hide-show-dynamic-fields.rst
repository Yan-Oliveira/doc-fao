Hide/Show Dynamic Fields
========================

A dynamic field enables the extension of the information stored in a ticket and the individual configuration of your **OTRS**. However, dynamic fields can also cause confusion when they appear in the wrong context.

A typical example of an internal IT department process is the ordering of hardware or software in **OTRS**. Dynamic fields help structure this order process through drop-down lists. For example, after choosing the hardware to be ordered, the feature add-on ensures that only appropriate choices will appear in the next step, e.g. screen, keyboard and printer. The dynamic fields defined for software, like word processing, image processing or spreadsheet software, will not be displayed.

   - Clarity and transparency for your users.
