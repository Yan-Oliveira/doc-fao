Install, Update and Uninstall
=============================

The packages can be installed, updated or uninstalled with the package manager in the administrator interface or using the command line tool.

.. note::

   You need to be in the *admin* group to access the administrator interface and use the `Package Manager <https://doc.otrs.com/doc/manual/admin/7.0/en/content/administration/package-manager.html>`__, which is described in the administration manual more detailed.

.. note::

   We assumed that username ``otrs`` is created for OTRS and it is installed to ``/opt/otrs``. If you use different user or install location, you need to change the install command. For more information about the command line tool execute this command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      otrs> /opt/otrs/bin/otrs.Console.pl Search 'Admin::Package'

   Then execute the needed command with ``--help`` option to see its possibilities.
