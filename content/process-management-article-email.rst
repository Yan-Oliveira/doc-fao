Process Management Article Email
================================

This feature add-on makes it possible to add email addresses to process management articles, as well as send them via email. This guarantees a more direct communication straight from the process and therefore increases the transparency of the process communication.

To use a process management article with this functionality, you must click on the pencil sign in the field *Add Article* of a previously created process with at least one activity dialog. In the form that appears you must select *Email external* or *Email internal* in the dropdown field *Article Type* and click *Save*.

After the process has been activated, you can open a new process ticket by clicking on the option of the same name displayed after clicking on the menu option *Ticket*. In the form that appears next, you can add an email address to the field *customer user* â€” just like when you are using the regular email ticket form. The article will be sent to the chosen customer user or agent.
