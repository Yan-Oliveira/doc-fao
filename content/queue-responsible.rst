Queue Responsible
=================

In service management, results depend on how tasks are assigned and making sure that no service request stays unanswered. Therefore, **OTRS** allows you to assign a responsible person to a ticket who takes care of solving it. However, in companies with many regional branches or many levels of hierarchy in their service management staff, there is a complex queue structure. This can make the responsibilities unclear and lead to meaningless reporting.

This feature add-on is the solution, because it allows you to assign a responsible party at the queue level.

Benefits
   - Clear separation of divisions by queue responsibles.
   - More significant reporting.
