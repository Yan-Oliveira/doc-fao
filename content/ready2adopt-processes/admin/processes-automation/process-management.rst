Process Management
==================

This package includes several examples of predefined processes that can help in some specific cases.

The following Ready2Adopt processes are available from the *Ready2Adopt Processes* widget:

- ``Conference Room Reservation``
- ``Office Materials Management``
- ``Order Request Management``
- ``Request for Leave Management``
- ``Start RMA``
- ``Travel expense``

To import a Ready2Adopt process:

1. Go to the *Process Management* screen in the administrator interface.
2. Select a process from the *Ready2Adopt Processes* widget in the left sidebar.
3. Click on the *Import Ready2Adopt process* button.
4. Deploy all processes.

During the process import, the system takes care of creating the needed dynamic fields and/or any needed updates to the system configuration.
