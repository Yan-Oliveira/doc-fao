Ready2Adopt Web Services
========================

Not only do you use a single instance of **OTRS**, but you may also use additional **OTRS** installations and other tools. This can make accessing data inconvenient. Luckily, the following web services provide a workaround:

- Jira connector
- Bugzilla connector
- OTRS-OTRS connector

Benefits
   - All data is centrally accessible in **OTRS**.
   - Execute arbitrary complex mappings through the XSLT mapping module.

   - IT
