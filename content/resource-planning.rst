Resource Planning
=================

This feature add-on provides a detailed overview of the entire teamâ€™s operations. By linking calendar entries with tickets, you have easy access to your appointments.

You can also use pre-defined authorization groups to create common calendars for select teams so that important information, such as meetings or deadlines, is available to all relevant agents.

Visualize which agent is responsible for which tasks and the expected amount of time needed to complete the tasks. Meetings, appointments and simple project planning are now centrally available for the entire department in **OTRS**.
