Restore Pending Information
===========================

With this feature add-on, your agents can save time dealing with recurring questions or follow-up messages from a customer. When the state *wait* is selected, certain fields will be completed automatically.

After your agent has answered a question from a customer and the customer wants to test the recommended solution, your agent can set the ticket status to *wait* and specify a reminder time, a subject and a text for internal documentation. If the customer sends another question before the reminder time runs out, your agent can answer and select the *wait* status again without having to re-enter the reminder time, title and text, as this information is now added automatically. If the reminder time expires, the default values are used.

Benefits
   - Fewer clicks and less work by using the memory function.
   - Saves time managing recurring requests from a client.
