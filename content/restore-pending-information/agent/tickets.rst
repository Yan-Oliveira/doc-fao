Tickets
=======

On opening the *Ticket Pending* screen the functionality pre-fills the fields with the restored information from the last pending reminder set by the agent. This includes the following fields, which are pre-filled in the ticket pending pop-up screen:

- Pending date
- State
- Title
- Text (if the text comes from a note article created by the *Ticket Pending* screen)

The functionality works only, when the target time is not expired, then the standard functionality sets the usual default values.
