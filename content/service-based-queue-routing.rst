Service-based Queue Routing
===========================

For a customer, excellent service initially starts with contacting the right service staff member. Being a help desk software, **OTRS** makes this possible with a clever queue and permission concept. However, if a ticket is created in the OTRS Customer Portal or in the agent frontend, one has to choose the suitable queue for his/her request from all existing and shown queues â€“ not an easy task for a customer or responsible agent. For example: a call center agent may not know which queue structure the service company has for the task on which he is working. This means a long decision-making times with a possible wrong result and the loss of precious working time.

This Feature Add-on now makes it possible to assign queues to several services, so that if this service is selected, then only the appropriate queues are shown. For example the service *Support Mobile Devices* can be assigned to the queues *IT-2nd Level-Support Hardware* and *IT-2nd Level Support Mobile Applications* so the right selection can be made more easily. This module can also be configured so that all queues can reappear with just one click. Time-consuming moves to the right queues and overextended customer users are a thing of the past.

Benefits
   - Simplified assignment of tickets in the correct queue without comprehensive knowledge about the queue structures.
   - Saving time.
   - Reduced workload.
