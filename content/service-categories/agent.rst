Agent Interface
===============

This package has no agent interface, but it extends the standard behavior of the service selection method.


Use Case Example
----------------

*Service One* and *Service Two* are assigned to type *Unclassified* in the :doc:`admin/ticket-settings/types-services` screen. Other services are not assigned.

To filter the services on the ticket create screens:

1. Go to any ticket create screen, for example *New Phone Ticket*.
2. Choose *Unclassified* ticket type.
3. Fill in the other customer fields.
4. Check what services are available in the *Service* drop-down.

.. note::

   *Customer Users ↔ Services* filter is applied before the one for *Types ↔ Services*.
