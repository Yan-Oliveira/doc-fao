Administrators are still able to see all available notification entries. To be able to differentiate between entries of administrators and agents, there is a new column *Personal* in the notification overview. The entries of agents are marked in orange and have the value *Yes* in the column *Personal*.

Furthermore it is still possible to add other agents as email recipients in every new or modified notification entry, including notification entries of agents.
