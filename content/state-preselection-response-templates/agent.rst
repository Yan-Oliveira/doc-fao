Agent Interface
===============

This package has no agent interface, but the package allows pre-selection of ticket states for response templates.

To pre-select a ticket state on reply:

1. Go to the *Ticket Zoom* screen and click on the *Reply* menu item in the article menu.
2. Select a response template from the drop-down list.
3. The pre-selected ticket state should be set on the *Next ticket state* field in the *Ticket Compose* window.

   The ticket state can be assigned in the :doc:`admin/ticket-settings/state-pre-selection-for-templates` management screen.
