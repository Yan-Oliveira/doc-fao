System Configuration History
============================

System configuration import and export are fully possible in the standard version of **OTRS**. An export always represents your complete configuration.

With this feature add-on, previous revisions can now be viewed and restored individually. This makes it easy to reset a setting, reducing errors and downtime. In addition, changes are auditable and revision-proof â€“ the system registers which changes have been made by whom.

Benefits
   - Error reduction by restoring configurations.
   - Detailed change log for all settings.
   - Accountability of changes.

Available in Service Package
   SILVER

Target Groups
   - IT
   - Security management
