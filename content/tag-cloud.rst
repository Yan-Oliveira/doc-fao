Tag Cloud
=========

This feature add-on provides a better overview of trends in ticket information with the help of assigned tags. Where the standard version of **OTRS** offers similar functionality with a lot more clicks, the tag cloud shows the information instantly, at a single glance, and in comparison to other results. For example, it is possible to visualize the workload of single agents or departments dynamically and to see the most up-to-date results. Likewise, the frequency of incidents with certain products can be measured constantly and can be compared with each other, which leads to a faster reaction on deviations.

The following ticket attributes can be visualized in the tag cloud:

- Ticket state
- Queue
- Owner
- Responsible
- Priority
- SLA
- Type
- All dynamic fields (e.g. error classes, products, etc.)

The larger a tag cloud is, the more the defined ticket attributes occur. The numbers in the brackets show the exact number of found tickets. With a direct click on a tag, the ticket search starts automatically and the related tickets are shown instantly.

Benefits
   - Find out about trends & habits at a glance.
   - See the dynamic and current workload of your agents.
