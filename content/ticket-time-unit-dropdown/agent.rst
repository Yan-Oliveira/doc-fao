This package transforms the *Time units* input field into drop-down lists. The drop-down lists can be configured in the system configuration of the :doc:`admin`.

To use the configured time units drop-down lists:

1. Open the *New Phone Ticket* screen or any other screen using time units.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the form and check the new *Time units* field.
