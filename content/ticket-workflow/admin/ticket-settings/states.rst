States
======

After installation of the package a new state is added to the system for the task tickets.


New State
---------

task pending dependency
   Tickets with unresolved dependencies are put into this state which is a type of removed. A removed indicates that the ticket is not viewable and will not appear in the usual views. A removed does not prevent the display in the linked ticket boxes.

   When the task tickets are created, the master ticket is put into the state defined as initial state in the system configuration or into *new*.
